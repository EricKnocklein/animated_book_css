This is a simple page that displays a book. Using CSS, this book can be opened to the front page, to the middle, or to the back page. 
It supports images or any other HTML content for the front cover, the front endsheet (the inside cover), the first page, the back of a page in the middle fo the book, the frot page of a page in the middle of the book, the back page, the back endsheet, the back cover, and the spine.

This would be a great starting point for more customization, and it should not be difficult to change the size and/or aspect ratio of the book without changing the math needed to make this work.

Note that setting the angle of the covers or the sections of the book beyond 90 degrees in either direction will cause some really strange side-effects.
